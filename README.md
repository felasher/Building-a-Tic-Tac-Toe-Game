# Tic Tac Toe CLI Game (Dart)

Tic Tac Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players. This CLI (Command Line Interface) version of Tic Tac Toe is implemented in Dart.

## How to Play

1. Run the game in your Dart environment.
2. Follow the instructions to take turns and enter your moves on the board.
3. The first player to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
4. If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Game Features

- Clear instructions and prompts to guide players through the game.
- Colorful display using ANSI escape codes for a visually appealing experience.
- Error handling to ensure valid moves and prevent crashes.

## Requirements

- Dart SDK installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Run the game using the Dart interpreter:
   ```

   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing additional features such as player names, scoring, and game modes.
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the game using Flutter.
